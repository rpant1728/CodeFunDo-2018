# CodeFunDo-2018
Project submission for CodeFunDo 2018.

In the spate of recent devastating natural disasters namely Hurricane Michael and Cyclone Titli, it becomes increasingly important that there exist a method for people in imminent danger to be able to broadcast their location to their loved ones and to be able to view nearby hospitals conveniently on their phones. We have created our app, Saviour, with this goal in our minds. We belive that it will be exceedingly helpful for those trapped due to the aftermath of these disasters, where urgent action is the difference between life and death.
